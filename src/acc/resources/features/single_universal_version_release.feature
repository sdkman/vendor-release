    Given the Consumer for groovy is making a request
    And the Consumer has a valid Auth Token
    And the URI /groovy-2.3.6.zip is available for download

  Scenario: Release a Universal Candidate Version
    Given an existing UNIVERSAL groovy Version 2.3.5 exists
    And the existing Default UNIVERSAL groovy Version is 2.3.5
    When a JSON POST on the /release/version endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "groovy",
          |  "version" : "2.3.6",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/groovy-2.3.6.zip"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 CREATED
    And groovy Version 2.3.6 with URL http://localhost:8080/groovy-2.3.6.zip was published as UNIVERSAL
    And the message "Released: groovy 2.3.6 for UNIVERSAL" is received

  Scenario: Attempt to Release a duplicate Version
    Given an existing UNIVERSAL groovy Version 2.3.5 exists
    And the existing Default UNIVERSAL groovy Version is 2.3.5
    When a JSON POST on the /release/version endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "groovy",
          |  "version" : "2.3.6",

          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 409 CONFLICT
    And the message "Duplicate: groovy 2.3.6 UNIVERSAL already exists" is received

  Scenario: Attempt to Release a Version for a non-existent Candidate
    Given Candidate groovy does not exist

    Then the status received is 400 BAD_REQUEST
    And the message "Invalid candidate: groovy" is received
    And the groovy version 2.3.6 UNIVERSAL does not exist
