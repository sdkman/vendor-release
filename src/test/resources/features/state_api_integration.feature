Feature: State API Dual Write

  Background:
    Given the consumer has a valid auth token
    And the state API is available

  Scenario: Release separate version and vendor with dual write
    Given the existing default MAC_OSX java version is 17.0.0
    And the consumer for candidate java|jmc is making a request
    And the URI /java-17.0.1.zip is available for download
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "java",
          |  "version" : "17.0.1",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/java-17.0.1.zip",
          |  "vendor" : "tem",
          |  "platform" : "MAC_OSX",
          |  "checksums" : {
          |    "MD5": "8f817c305a1bb15428b4aa29b844d75c",
          |    "SHA-256": "01bfe9d471b7cb1f8321204e6fa05a574db3ae5b67c5bd2f17184ffd521387f1"
          |  }
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 CREATED
    And java version 17.0.1-tem with URL http://localhost:8080/java-17.0.1.zip was published for MAC_OSX to mongodb
    And the state API received a POST request with platform MAC_X64
    And the state API received a POST request with vendor tem
    And the state API received a POST request with version 17.0.1
    And the state API received a POST request with md5sum 8f817c305a1bb15428b4aa29b844d75c
    And the state API received a POST request with sha256sum 01bfe9d471b7cb1f8321204e6fa05a574db3ae5b67c5bd2f17184ffd521387f1

  Scenario: Release version and platform mapping with dual write
    Given the existing default PLATFORM_SPECIFIC java version is 17.0.1-tem
    And the consumer for candidate java|jmc is making a request
    And the URI /java-17.0.1.zip is available for download
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "java",

          |  "platform" : "LINUX_64"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 CREATED
    And the state API received a POST request with platform LINUX_X64

  Scenario: Release version and unspecified vendor with dual write
    Given the existing default PLATFORM_SPECIFIC java version is 17.0.1-tem
    And the consumer for candidate java|jmc is making a request
    And the URI /java-17.0.1.zip is available for download
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:

          |  "platform" : "MAC_OSX"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 CREATED
    And the state API received a POST request WITHOUT vendor

  Scenario: Release version still succeeds when State API is unavailable
    Given the existing default UNIVERSAL java version is 17.0.1
    And the consumer for candidate java|jmc is making a request
    And the URI /java-17.0.1.zip is available for download
    And the state API is unavailable
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:

          |  "platform" : "UNIVERSAL"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 CREATED
    And java version 17.0.1 with URL http://localhost:8080/java-17.0.1.zip was published for UNIVERSAL to mongodb
