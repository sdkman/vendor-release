Feature: Release multi-platform version

  Background:
    Given the consumer for candidate java|jmc is making a request
    And the consumer has a valid auth token
    And the URI /zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.131-linux_x64.tar.gz is available for download
    And the URI /zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.131-macosx.tar.gz is available for download
    And the state API is available

  Scenario: Release a single multi-platform binary version
    Given an existing LINUX_64 java version 8u121-zulu exists
    And the existing default PLATFORM_SPECIFIC java version is 8u121-zulu
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "java",
          |  "version" : "8u131",
          |  "vendor" : "zulu",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.131-linux_x64.tar.gz",
          |  "platform" : "LINUX_64"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 CREATED
    And java version 8u131-zulu with URL http://localhost:8080/zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.131-linux_x64.tar.gz was published for LINUX_64 to mongodb
    And the message "Released: java 8u131-zulu for LINUX_64" is received

  Scenario: Release multiple multi-platform binaries of the same version
    Given an existing LINUX_64 java version 8u121-zulu exists
    And the existing default PLATFORM_SPECIFIC java version is 8u121-zulu
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "java",
          |  "version" : "8u131",
