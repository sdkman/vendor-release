Feature: Release endpoint security

  Background:
    Given the URI /groovy-2.3.6.zip is available for download
    And the state API is available

  Scenario: The release endpoints can NOT be accessed without a valid auth token
    Given the consumer for candidate groovy is making a request
    And the consumer does not have a valid auth token
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "groovy",
          |  "version" : "2.3.6",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/groovy-2.3.6.zip"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 403 "FORBIDDEN"

  Scenario: The release endpoints can NOT be accessed by an invalid consumer
    Given the consumer for candidate scala is making a request
    And the consumer has a valid auth token
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "groovy",
          |  "version" : "2.3.6",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/groovy-2.3.6.zip"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 403 "FORBIDDEN"

  Scenario: The release endpoints CAN be accessed when authorised as valid consumer
    Given the consumer for candidate groovy is making a request
    And the consumer has a valid auth token
    And the UNIVERSAL candidate groovy with default version 2.3.6 already exists
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "groovy",
          |  "version" : "2.3.6",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/groovy-2.3.6.zip"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 "CREATED"

  Scenario: The release endpoints CAN be accessed when authorised with valid list of consumers
    Given the consumer for candidate grails|groovy is making a request
    And the consumer has a valid auth token
    And the UNIVERSAL candidate groovy with default version 2.3.6 already exists
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "groovy",
          |  "version" : "2.3.6",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/groovy-2.3.6.zip"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 "CREATED"

  Scenario: The release endpoints CAN be accessed when authorised as administrator
    Given the consumer for candidate default_admin is making a request
    And the consumer has a valid auth token
    And the UNIVERSAL candidate groovy with default version 2.3.6 already exists
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "groovy",
          |  "version" : "2.3.6",
