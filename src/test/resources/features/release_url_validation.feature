Feature: Release URL validation

  Background:
    Given the consumer for candidate java is making a request
    And the consumer has a valid auth token
    And the state API is available

  Scenario: The URI is a valid resolving resource
    Given the existing default PLATFORM_SPECIFIC java version is 8u121-zulu
    And the URI /zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.131-linux_x64.tar.gz is available for download
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "java",
          |  "version" : "8u131-zulu",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.131-linux_x64.tar.gz",
          |  "platform" : "LINUX_64"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 201 CREATED

  Scenario: The URI is NOT a valid resolving resource
    Given the existing default PLATFORM_SPECIFIC java version is 8u121-zulu
    And the URI /zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.999-linux_x64.tar.gz is not available for download
    When a JSON POST on the /versions endpoint:
    """
          |{
          |  "candidate" : "java",
          |  "version" : "8u131-zulu",
          |  "url" : "http://localhost:8080/zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.999-linux_x64.tar.gz",
          |  "platform" : "LINUX_64"
          |}
    """
    Then the status received is 400 BAD_REQUEST
    And the message "URL cannot be resolved: http://localhost:8080/zulu8.21.0.1-jdk8.0.999-linux_x64.tar.gz" is received
