# [Rules Topic/Domain Name]

Brief description of the rules domain and its scope. What aspect of development, architecture, or methodology do these rules govern? Keep this concise and focused on the purpose and boundaries of these rules.

## Context

Provide the situational context where these rules apply. This helps the LLM understand when and why to apply these rules.

*Applies to:* [Project types, layers, components, or scenarios where these rules are relevant]
*Level:* [Strategic/Tactical/Operational - helps prioritize rule application]
*Audience:* [Developers/Architects/Product Team - who should follow these rules]

## Core Principles

List the fundamental principles that underpin all the detailed rules. These are the "why" behind the rules and help with decision-making when specific rules don't cover a scenario.

1. *Principle Name:* Brief explanation of the principle and its importance
2. *Principle Name:* Brief explanation of the principle and its importance
3. *Principle Name:* Brief explanation of the principle and its importance

## Rules

### Must Have (Critical)
Non-negotiable rules that must always be followed. Violation of these rules should block progress.

- *RULE-001:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance
- *RULE-002:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance
- *RULE-003:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance

### Should Have (Important)
Strong recommendations that should be followed unless there's a compelling reason not to.

- *RULE-101:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance
- *RULE-102:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance
- *RULE-103:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance

### Could Have (Preferred)
Best practices and preferences that improve quality but are not blocking.

- *RULE-201:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance
- *RULE-202:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance
- *RULE-203:* Description of the rule with clear, actionable guidance

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### ✅ Do This
Concrete examples of what good implementation looks like

// Example of good practice in code block
// Clear, concise code example

### ❌ Don't Do This
Concrete examples of what to avoid

// Example of anti-pattern in code block
// Clear example of what not to do

## Decision Framework

Provide guidance for making decisions when rules conflict or when faced with novel situations

*When rules conflict:*
1. Step 1 for resolution
2. Step 2 for resolution
3. Step 3 for resolution

*When facing edge cases:*
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
- Guideline 3

## Exceptions & Waivers

Define when and how these rules can be broken

*Valid reasons for exceptions:*
- Reason 1 (with approval process if needed)
- Reason 2 (with approval process if needed)
- Reason 3 (with approval process if needed)

*Process for exceptions:*
1. Document the exception and rationale
2. [Additional approval steps if needed]
3. [Time-bound review if applicable]

## Quality Gates

Define how adherence to these rules should be verified

- *Automated checks:* What can be validated through tooling
- *Code review focus:* What reviewers should specifically look for
- *Testing requirements:* How rule compliance should be tested
